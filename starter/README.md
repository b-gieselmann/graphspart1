Names: Brooke Gieselmann. And also Lola helped me and also Sam helped

My implementation is based on the interface provided, with the exception of the add_edge method because the listed one didn't include a source node, so instead I borrowed the source code from old_graph.py to write my own "add_edge". 

It's in python. Run program.py in python3. 

Building the map graph assumes the list of edges does not have duplicates. Ideally it would check for edges first if I worked on this longer. It does check for vertices before adding them.
